aristonl's hydra directory.

This is my main work directory for hydra where you
can find all the scripts and configs I use to maintain
Hydra.

MAIN/

This folder contains all scripts specific to 
maintaining the main tree of Hydra along with the
repositories themselves.

SCRIPTS/

This folder contains all scripts that can be used
universally or by other applications (such as neomutt
for appling patches). This is added to $PATH

STABLE/

This folder contains all scripts specific to
maintaining the stable tree of Hydra along with the
repositories themselves.
